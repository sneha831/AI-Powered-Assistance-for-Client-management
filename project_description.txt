Combining Idea 1 (Medical Data Integrity & Anomaly Detection System) and Idea 2 (Intelligent Software Issue Classifier & Prioritizer) into a single project is not only possible, but it can actually become a very unique, impressive, and company-relevant solution — especially for a company like Intelligence Science, which works in medical + business system development.

Let me explain:

🧠🔗 Unified Project: Smart Medical Support Monitoring & Issue Management System
💡 What is it?
A two-part intelligent system that:

Automatically detects anomalies in medical/business data

Lets users report issues, which are then auto-classified and prioritized using AI

🔄 How the Two Parts Work Together
PART 1: Medical/Business Data Anomaly Detection
The system scans uploaded files or data (e.g., patient records, billing data)

Uses rules + AI models to find:

Missing data

Unusual values (e.g., blood pressure 300, age 200)

Data that deviates from normal patterns (anomaly detection)

📍When something suspicious is found, it’s logged into the system as a "Detected Issue."

PART 2: Issue Reporting & Smart Ticket Handling
Users (e.g., hospital staff or admins) can report other issues manually

Each issue — whether manually reported or auto-detected — is:

Auto-tagged with priority (Low, Medium, High)

Assigned to a responsible team (e.g., DB, Backend)

Summarized using AI

Tracked in a clean dashboard

✅ Why This Combo Works So Well
💡 Feature	✅ Value
Real-time anomaly detection	Prevents errors in medical/business systems early
AI-based issue classification	Speeds up internal support
Combines automation + user input	Balanced and flexible
Relevant to medical + enterprise domains	Matches company’s business scope
Useful for internal QA teams or hospitals	Real practical use case

📦 Final System Overview (Simple Words)
You're building a web tool that helps a company keep medical/business data clean and also manage system issues efficiently — using AI to spot bad data and prioritize problems.
✅ Combined Project: Smart Issue & Data Anomaly Manager for Medical Systems
🔍 What is it?
You're building a web-based system that does two main things:

Checks medical or system data for mistakes (wrong values, missing info, weird numbers).

Handles and prioritizes software issues (like bugs reported by hospitals or staff), using AI to figure out what’s urgent and who should fix it.

🧠 How it works:
A hospital system sends data (like patient records, billing, etc.) or reports a technical problem.

Your system:

Scans the data for errors — e.g., patient age is 200, or billing is 10x normal → it flags it.

Reads support tickets (problem reports) — and uses AI to:

Automatically classify the problem (e.g., Payment bug, Login error)

Decide how urgent it is (Low, Medium, High)

Suggest which team (backend/frontend/data) should handle it

🎯 Why it’s useful:
Saves time for the company's internal support team

Helps detect issues early (even before customers complain)

Improves data quality and makes hospital systems more reliable

Makes the company look more professional and efficient to clients

🏥 Example:
Let’s say a hospital sends:

A billing record where a patient was charged ₹10,00,000 for a minor test

And a ticket: “System freezes during payment process”

Your system will:

Flag the billing as a data anomaly

Mark the system freeze as a High-priority backend issue, summarize the problem, and assign it to the right team

💡 Final Result:
A small but powerful AI tool that helps the company deliver:
